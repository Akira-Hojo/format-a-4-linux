# format-a-4-linux
A terrible shell script to automate making DOS floppies on Linux while using USB floppy drives based around ufiformat and mkfs

Save in your favorite location and add an alias to your shells running config.

Now with added quick formatting capabilities!!

Writeen on Arch, your success may vary...
