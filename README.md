# format-a-4-linux
A terrible shell script to automate making DOS floppies on Linux while using USB floppy drives based around ufiformat and mkfs

I recently came into posession of a large collection of Mavica floppy disk cameraas and wanted an easy to remember way to format any DOS floppy I wanted in Linux. So, here ya go pal.

Save in your favorite location and add an alias to your shells running config.

Now with added quick formatting capabilities!!

Written on Arch, your success may vary...
